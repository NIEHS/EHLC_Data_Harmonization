# EHLC_Data_Harmonization
Repository for holding content from the data harmonization use case.  This repository holds:

Crosstab_X_Y.xlsx:  manually generated mappings of variables from studies X and Y.  Overview tab in each
spreadsheet describes the tabs and details.

MappingResults.xlsx: holds the counts of manual mappings between pairs of studies.

data_prep.py: code to prep for analysis, including converting manually mapped data into analysis format
and to generate embeddings for each variable to support analysis.  A OpenAI key is needed to run this code.

run_analysis.py: code to generate a computer based mapping of variables between studies (using embeddings
for similiarity between pairs of variables) and compare the computer and manual mappings.

gen_heatmap.py: throw away code used to create a heatmap of cross study mappings based on embeddings as
a sanity check on using the embeddings.

overall_best_results.xlsx: holds results of comparing manual and computer based mappings using the OpenAI 
text-embedding-3-large model.

2016-34-DD-DemoHealth.xlsx: data dictionary for study 2016-34
2016-1407-DD-DemoHealth.xlsx: data dictionary for study 2016-1407
2016-1450-DD-DemoHealth.xlsx: data dictionary for study 2016-1450
2016-1740-DD-DemoHealth.xlsx: data dictionary for study 2016-1740
2017-1945-DD-DemoHealth.xlsx: data dictionary for study 2016-1945

Note: this repository uses a different naming convention for the studies than that publication. 
The mapping between names in this repository and the paper are:
2016-1450 = Study A
2016-1407 = Study B
2016-1945 = Study C
2016-34 = Study D
2016-1740 = Study E
